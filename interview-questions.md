# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: 
Git is a version control system. The difference between git and Github, is Github functions as an outlet for users to upload their work from local sources like their laptops to the web. It allows them to keep their progress in a safe place in case something were to happen to their local source. Github is also a great place for developers to build their portfolios for future employers to look at their work. Git just controls the actual code.
  Researched answer:
After going over some additional resources, I have a better understaning of Git as being the system that allows ease of sharing code. Also known as the Git workflow, which shows the path the code travels through passing the terminal in order to be shared to places such as Github for others to contribute as well. Git stands for Global Informational Tracker.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:
  AND and OR are the operators that will return a Boolean value. Boolean values are always true or false answers of the given function. An example would be if(variable < 10 && > 2) both have to be true to return true. An example of OR would be if(variable < 10 || > 5) only one side of it can be true for it to return true.

  Researched answer:
  The operators that will return a Boolean value are called logical operators. They include AND, OR, and NOT. As stated, the AND has to be true for both sides in order to return a true value (or false depending on the inputs). The OR will only need 1 of the sides to be true to return a true value (or false). The logcal NOT is represented with the (!) that is called a bang operator which will return the opposite. An example of this would be !true â€” returns as false.


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:
  An index is each "part" of an array. If an array has strings, than the indexes are each string that is separated by a comma. If an array has numbers, each number separated by commas are counted as an index. Indexes start from zero as the first one in the array and are held within brackets. The difference between index and value, is that a value is held within parentheses and is usually a parameter assigned to a function or method. An index is held within brackets as an array. You can return a value from an index.

  Researched answer:
  The index is a location of the value within an array. The index serves as a place to find the given value you are seeking. It does, however, start in the array at zero. The array as a whole is known as an element and the contents of it is known as it's value. For example, [1, 2, 3]: 1 is the value but it is held at index 0.




4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:
  I am not too familiar with the term iteration at this time, but I will get back to you on the term when I have a better understanding of it.

  Researched answer:
  Iteration is when a code can be ran again and again in order to meet a condition. The best way I can explain this, is by showing how for loops preform. For loops will take a given starting index, a given stop index (or how many times you want the iteration to preform), and a given number of intervals of indexes to act on. The iteration, if not given a specific place to stop or condition to be met, will contiue to run like the legendary Forrest Gump.




5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
  Proper pair programming techniques can look like two people bouncing off of each other with insight on how to tackle problems within code or even just developing code in general. There is amazing brain storming between the two minds working on the same output and how to achieve it in the best practical way. Pair programming techniques include a lot of team work, communication, and open mindness. If done effectively, pair programming can expand the knowledge and perspective of both developers. The roles include a "Driver" and a "Navigator". The "Driver" is the person with "hands on code" for instance. They are the one actually manipulating the code, while the "Navigator" is the one overseeing and giving input. Ideally the "Navigator" is giving direction, looking for grammar and syntax, and talking through the coding with the "Driver".

  Researched answer:
  Techniques best practiced in pair programming is switching! There is something known as the pomodoro method, in which a task is decided upon and assigned to each person so that the pair can alternate different parts of the project with a set timer to alert each person that it is time to switch roles. Incorporating short breaks to battle fatigue and regain focus.




## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:
- Higher-Order functions take in and act on another function and they can return a function. Their parameters will act upon arrays. They can take can take a specified array and return a new array with modified outputs based on what you asked it to do. Higher-Order functions are sort of a way to shorten code because it can take on functions to produce a modified efficient shorthand version of them. These functions preform by understanding the value of given functions and values of arrays in order to create the expected outputs.

2. Jest:
- Jest most definitely is comparable to the scientific method, in my opinion. It will be the best way to avoid missing the essentials of your code. It makes you think about what you want out of your code. For example, the (describe) method lists the name of the function kind of giving you the observation of what's to come. The (test) or (it) is basically like your hypothesis of the function and explains what it is doing. Lastly the (expect) is similar to the prediction because it is supposed to call the function being tested and what is expected. Then after doing the (describe) method, when you run (yarn jest) in terminal, it is testing your prediction. Which will give you a lot of information on what went wrong and where you need to go back to the drawing board in order to optimize the code.

3. Objects:
- (Objects) is the collection of information that can be called upon in different ways. It can be called upon to only select specific values of a variables element. it can also take on methods that affect the behavior of the information in the (object). For example, creating a variable that contains a function within the (object) to call upon and return desired output. You can also pair specific items in an (object) so that you can call on specific combinations of them later as well. Just as (Jest) worked as the information was nested, (Objects) are also nested information.

4. Method:
- (Method) is when your (object) has a behavior because there is a function that is nested within the (object). The function could be combining other keys that are, too, within the (object).

5. Classes:
- (Classes) are like a declaration for an (object) and it's nested data/behaviors. My understanding of (classes) is that the class declares the object and it's keys. For example, the (class), announces/declares as a variable, the (object) and (keys) in it's scope. The (constructor) creates the (object). The (this) refers to data/ or behavior that belongs under the (object) like a (key), after the (constructor) gave the introduction. (New) is giving a newly declared variable access to your established (class). After the (new) is declared, you can then call upon specific data or bahavior from the (class).
